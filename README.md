# Linear_Regression_CGPA_vs_Package

## 📌 Project Overview
This projects demonstrates a **Linear Regression model built using scikit-learn**
This basically predict a student's placement package based on their CGPA

The objective of this project is to understand the **complete machine learning workflow**, from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and visualization.


## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Input Feature (X):** CGPA  
- **Target Variable (y):** Placement Package (in LPA)


## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## 🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Covered
- Simple Linear Regression
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training using scikit-learn
- Model Evaluation (MSE, R² Score)
- Best Fit Line Visualization
- Making predictions on new data


## 🪜 Project Workflow
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and prepare the dataset
3. Reshape data for scikit-learn
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train the Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Plot the best-fit regression line
8. Predict package for a new CGPA value


## 📈 Output
- Displays a scatter plot of actual data
- Shows the best-fit regression line
- Prints:
  - Slope (m)
  - Intercept (b)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Predicts package for a given CGPA
